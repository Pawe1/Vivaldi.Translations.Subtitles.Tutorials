Vivaldi lets you cut down the clutter and

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,720
organise your tabs into groups called Tab Stacks.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,940
To create a new Stack, simply click and drag a tab on top of another tab,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,240
hold it until the tab below becomes dark and drop it in.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,080
Thatâ€™s all there is to it!

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,600
To ungroup your tabs, right click on a Tab
Stack and select 'Ungroup Tab Stack'.
