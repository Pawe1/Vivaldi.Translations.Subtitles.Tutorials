Here’s how to add a new Web Panel in Vivaldi

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,540
To get started, expand the main Panel by clicking the Show Panel toggle in the Status Bar.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,360
In the expanded view, you’ll now see icons for your Bookmarks, Downloads, and Notes.

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,420
Below that, there is a “plus” sign which can be used to add new Web Panels.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,080
Click this plus sign, enter the URL for the site you’d like to add, and hit Enter.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,080
You’re new panel is live - and will be ready
for you

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,820
whenever you relaunch the browser or open a new window.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,720
Web Panels are a great way to keep up with social feeds and messenger apps throughout the day,

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,420
or to quickly access tools that you find yourself visiting regularly.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,020
Any page can be added as a Web Panel.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,060
Simply open the page you’d like to add, right-click anywhere

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,640
and select “Add Page to Web Panel” from the menu.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,900
Keep in mind that due to the smaller view area, mobile-friendly sites will work best.

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,420
Thanks for watching.

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,740
